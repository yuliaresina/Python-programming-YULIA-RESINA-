LINEAR CLASSIFICATION ALGORITM

The program classifies the data into two different classes using a linear function.
The program reads data from the file unlabelled_data.csv
A linear function is created by entering the values of "x", "k" and "m".
Afterwards, the data is classified with reference to this linear function into two different classes.
At the end, a graph ograph where the points, their class and the line all
are displayed, and a file is created with a list of labbelled data.
